Hello Earthlings!

  I have been sent to Mars to check the viability of the Mars ONE project. It's been quite lonely here as you can imagine; the only recent visitors being the Curiosity Rover, and Mangalyaan. I thought what better way to connect with my fellow earthlings than through a Github account..so, here I am!
  
Sincerely,
An illegal Martian

P.S. If we don't tighten our bootstraps and deal with the global warming crisis while it's still manageable, we will have to deal with the 95% CO2 atmosphere in Mars, it's not comfortable!
